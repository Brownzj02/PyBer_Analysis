# PyBer Rideshare Analysis
Analyzing data for a Python based application.---
## Overview
In this application I am analyzing python data for rideshare company, Pyber. In this analysis I am expected to analyze the date to create charts and visual representation for extensive rows of date contained in a CSV file. The expectation is to review rates and make ridesharing more accessible to underrepresented areas.---
## Results
*Per the analysis, urban rides make up the largest portion of the market and pay the lowest fares. This could be based on a variety of factors including distance and time.

*These results are somewhere in the middle based on number of drivers and fares. May be subject to the same issues as rural areas based on population and distance.

*Rural areas have the highest fares and the lowest number of drivers. This could be based on population, distance of travel, and possibly other cost factors like fuel surcharges. Charges appear to be disproportionately different between urban and rural areas. ---

## Summary
There are three recommendations I would give to the CEO. Firstly, I would recommend the company evaluate their price structure. There is nothing that can be done about the oversaturation of drivers in urban areas due to population density, but there should be consideration if a driver in an urban area and a driver in a rural area are both travelling 10 miles for example, but are paying vastly different prices. That is an issue that needs to addressed especially to establish why those prices vary. Secondly, I'd recommend some incentive to drivers to that are near urban/suburban areas to do more ridesharing futher from their start point. While it could level out or raise the prices in another area type, it could bring new drivers into markets they may not otherwise travel to. Lastly, I'd recommend creating more affordable ride options if possible or partnering with community based orgainzations and businesses to lower costs for rural areas. This would require additonal anaylsis, but in some cases rural areas are affected with lower income populations and limited access to public transportation. For example building a partnership to transport seniors, disabled people, low income populations or working with car dealers as an option to tranport customers, this could generate additonal income, make the company more marketable, and offset costs making Pyber more affordable and accessible.
